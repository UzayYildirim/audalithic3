## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### Music Server Setup

You need a remote music server hosting:

1. **Audio files** organized by language:
   ```
   your-music-server.com/
   â”œâ”€â”€ audio/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ English/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ song1.mp3
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ song2.mp3
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Spanish/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ song1.mp3
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ song2.mp3
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [Other Languages]/
   â””â”€â”€ manifest.json
   ```

2. **Manifest file** (`manifest.json`) at the root:
   ```json
   {
     "languages": {
       "English": ["song1", "song2", "song3"],
       "Spanish": ["cancion1", "cancion2", "cancion3"],
       "French": ["chanson1", "chanson2", "chanson3"]
     }
   }
   ```

**Important notes:**
- Song titles in `manifest.json` should NOT include the `.mp3` extension
- Audio files should be accessible at: `{AUDIO_BASE_URL}/audio/{language}/{title}.mp3`
- The server must support CORS if the app is hosted on a different domain
- Both the manifest and audio files should be publicly accessible
